    - there is the same number of paragraphs in the passed-in `CatechismStructure` object as in the map
    - all paragraph numbers are included (test against a passed-in `CatechismStructure` object)
        - each map entry is populated with a single `Paragraph`, and `map.entry.key` matches `map.entry.value.paragraphNumber`
