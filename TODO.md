# Tasks to complete once it has been decided to release a production-ready version

- [ ] investigate more efficient content-loading mechanisms, e.g.
  - can pages for all renderable routes be statically generated and cached on the server?
  - can all JSON content be loaded in-memory on the server?
- [ ] verify the translations in `catechism/artifact-builders/utils.ts` and `catechism/source/utils/semantic-path.ts`
      are correct

- [ ] note-taking and highlighting
  - [ ] permanent and temporary storage (easily toggleable)

  - [ ] recordered audio (better than a screen reader)
