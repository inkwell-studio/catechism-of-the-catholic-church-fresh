  - [ ] handle RTL languages
  - [ ] fonts to consider
    - [ ] Bookman
    - [ ] Alegreya

- merge

- [ ] implement hierarchical navigation
- merge

- [ ] look into "ahead-of-time" builds: https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/concepts/ahead-of-time-builds
- [ ] research artifact caching methods

## Unprioritized

- [ ] consider using a component library for buttons and other like elements
  - https://mantine.dev/
  - https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives
  - https://chakra-ui.com/
  - https://headlessui.com/
- [ ] determine the proper status code to use for the paragraph-number redirects
- [ ] add helpful information and links to the 404 page
- [ ] look into using Astral for e2e testing: https://astral.deno.dev/
- [ ] consider improving artifact management
  - should artifacts not be commited, and instead be built during deployment?
- [ ] UI: style for LTR and RTL text
- [ ] add e2e UI tests to validate links
- [ ] add a UI language switcher
  - [ ] update all user-facing text to be
- [ ] add JSON validation for `catechism.json`
- [ ] render all content
  - [ ] handle all TODO's in `content.tsx`
  - [ ] re-do the rendering structures (reorganize components, etc.)
  - [ ] opening content
  - [ ] citation markers
  - [ ] is there anything else?
- [ ] implement content loading
  - [ ] cross-reference navigation
  - [ ] chapter > chapter navigation
  - [ ] routing
    - [ ] to in-page anchor tags
- UI:
  - consider if any of the official Tailwind presets would be useful:
    - https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins#official-plugins
  - consider using Radix UI things:
    - https://www.radix-ui.com/colors
    - https://www.radix-ui.com/
    - https://icons.radix-ui.com/
  - [ ] consider using the following colors:
    - [ ] #E86D82 (red-pink)
- [ ] implement unimplemented tests
- [ ] add a test to ensure that all cross-references are paired (in `catechism.test.ts`)
- [ ] implement hierarchical navigation
- [ ] implement historical navigation
- [ ] implement search
- [ ] implement index
- [ ] implement glossary
- [ ] implement "copy" buttons (click a button to copy the entire text of a paragraph, quote, etc.)

# Tasks to complete once it has been decided to release a production-ready version

- [ ] investigate more efficient content-loading mechanisms, e.g.
  - can pages for all renderable routes be statically generated and cached on the server?
  - can all JSON content be loaded in-memory on the server?
- [ ] verify the translations in `catechism/artifact-builders/utils.ts` and `catechism/source/utils/semantic-path.ts`
      are correct

# Possible features

- [ ] the ability to ask a question in natural language (via text or mic), e.g. "What happens in the Sacrament of
      Confirmation?"
- [ ] note-taking and highlighting
  - [ ] permanent and temporary storage (easily toggleable)
- [ ] narration
  - [ ] recordered audio (better than a screen reader)
  - [ ] text is highlighted to follow along (toggleable)
