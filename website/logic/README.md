No code should be placed immediately within this `logic` directory. Instead, all code should be placed in one of the
subdirectories according to its usage:

| Directory | Purpose                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| `/client` | Code for the client only       |
| `/server` | Code for the server only       |
| `/shared` | Code for the client and server |
